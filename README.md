# Klassroom

### This app began as a solution for teachers who use groupwork in their classes and want to quickly make ideal groups based on user-chosen criteria.  The idea was originally developed in collaboration with @RudyRigot
### First choose your criteria and give them a name.  You can choose as many as you want.
### Next, enter the names of the students in your class.
### Next, give each student a rank for the criteria.
### Finally, click "Generate tables" and Klassroom will generate ideal tables based on student rankings
